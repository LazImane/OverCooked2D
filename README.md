###################GAME MANAGER SCRIPT###########################
This script sets up a basic kitchen system for the game. It registers all station nodes in the scene, categorizes them by type, and initializes some example ingredients and recipes.
A utility function is provided to check the status of any ingredient.

For future improvements, the ingredient and recipe data could be loaded from external files (JSON or CSV) to allow easier expansion.
